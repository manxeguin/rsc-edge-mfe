# Playing with Unstable React Server Components for Generating Static Apps

This project explores the use of Unstable React Server Components (RSC) to generate static apps. The goal is to experiment with RSC, which is a new feature in React that allows for server-side rendering of React components with a more efficient rendering model.

## Demo

The result of this experiment is a demo app hosted on GitHub Pages: https://manxeguin.github.io/rsc-edge-mfe/

## Local Installation

To run the project locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once you have those installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/manxeguin/rsc-edge-mfe.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd rsc-edge-mfe`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm i`
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
5. Start the development server: `npm start`

Once the development server is running, you can view the app in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
